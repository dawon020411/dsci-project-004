Introduction
Heart disease (cardiovascular disease) is a leading cause of death worldwide, with millions of lives lost each year. Early diagnosis of heart disease is crucial because it enables timely intervention and preventive measures, ultimately improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals affected by this condition. The fight against this pervasive health issue increasingly leverages data analysis to identify risk factors, improve diagnostic methods, and tailor treatments more effectively. Therefore, this project focuses on analyzing a heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, by critical variables such as gender, age, and cholesterol level as predictors.

"In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is an integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0)." (Janosi et al., 1988)

Can age, gender and cholesterol level collectively serve as predictors for identifying patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease?

We chose age, cholesterol level, and gender as variables for identifying heart disease because these factors significantly influence the likelihood of developing cardiovascular conditions. Age reflects the cumulative effect of aging on the cardiovascular system, cholesterol levels indicate lipid-related risk factors, and gender influences the timing and magnitude of heart disease risk.

For our research question, we use the 'Processed Cleveland' dataset. This dataset includes various variables obtained from 300 patients, including age (year), gender, cholesterol levels (mg/dl), and diagnostic outcomes.
